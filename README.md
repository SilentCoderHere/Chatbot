# 🤖 Chat Bot

This is a small Python chatbot made for learning purposes. It uses simple if-else rules to reply to users and fuzzy string matching to handle small spelling mistakes. The goal is to understand how basic chatbots work, not to build something advanced.

## ✨ Features

* **Rule-based replies**
  Uses straightforward if-else logic to respond to known inputs.

* **Spelling correction**
  Uses the Levenshtein Distance algorithm so the bot can still understand input with minor spelling errors.

* **Simple terminal interface**
  Runs in the command line and is easy to use.

## 🚀 How to Run
